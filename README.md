Creating and implementing Interfaces
Declare a class Comparison which implements both interfaces and has one string property 'Name'.
Add the correct access modifiers to the code above (Visual Studio should help)

Implement the interfaces in the class then code out the two methods to permit comparison of two strings

CompareByName() : compares by alphabetical order (string.Compare() method)
	
CompareByLength() : compares by length (custom build your own code here)

See if you can manage to build an application which accepts two strings and compares them both alphabetically and also by length.

The output should read something like

'String1 is above/below/the same as String2 alphabetically'

'String1 is shorter/longer/the same length compared to String2'
